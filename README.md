# CS5112-Project-Friend-Recommendation
This is the assignment that we are using as reference for the project: https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse140/13wi/homework/hw4/homework4.html

We are looking to complete Parts 1 and 2 before checkpoint, which is due at the end of Monday (not Tuesday!)

Here is also the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection for additional dataset that we might need in the future (including Twitter and Friendster data): http://snap.stanford.edu/data/#communities
